# Ta-Da! (yes, another To-Do List ðŸ˜„)

This project is part of **The Odin Project** JavaScript course: [Assignment link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

## Description

A fully-featured **To-Do List** application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, bundled with **Webpack**.  
It supports **projects** and **tasks within each project**, and it persists data using **Local Storage**, so your tasks remain saved between sessions. On first load, some demo entries are pre-populated to show functionality.

## Features

- **Project Management:** Create, rename, and delete projects.
- **Task Management:** Add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task stores a title, description, due date, priority, and project association.
- **Task View:** Expand or collapse task descriptions for a cleaner overview.
- **Tabs:** View tasks across multiple tabs: All Tasks, Today, Upcoming (next 7 days), Completed, Expired or by individual project.
- **Sorting:** Sort tasks by priority or due date, ascending or descending, or keep the default order.
- **State Persistence:** Uses Local Storage to save your tasks and projects across browser sessions.

## Future Features

- Legend for priority colors
- Confirmation dialogs for deleting projects or tasks
- Style updates for an improved UI
- And of courseâ€¦ fix some miiiiiiiinor bugs ðŸ˜¬
